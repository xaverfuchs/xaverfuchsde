## About me <i class="fa fa-robot" style="font-size:120%; color:limegreen;"></i>
I am an experimental psychologist and neuroscientist. I did my PhD on phantom limbs and body perception. 
My main topics are perceptual and cerebral _own-body representation_, _touch_ perception, and _pain_. 
I strive to learn more about human behavioral and neuroscience research in this field and beyond. My main methodological focus is on experimental design, and assessment and analysis of behavioral data using psychophysical methods. 

Apart from doing research, I am a bass player & musical composer as well as convinced cyclist and nature lover. 🎸🚲🏔💚

I am married to my favorite human, Marta, an English-Italian artist, neuroscientist and cellist. We live in Salzburg, Austria. 

## Bio <i class="fas fa-lg fa-carrot" style="font-size:120%; color:limegreen;"></i>
I spend the first years of my childhood in the 1980s in a commune in the (western) German countryside that my parents and friends founded during the 60s/70s hippie movement. When I was in elementary school, my family moved to **Darmstadt** where I spent my youth and finished school.

I studied **psychology** at University of **Marburg**, Germany. During that time I also intensified making music and founded the music label _quadratisch rekords_ with friends. 
After my studies I did my **PhD** at the Central Institute of Mental Health in **Mannheim**, Germany, under the supervision of Prof. Herta Flor. 

I then went to **Bielefeld**, Germany, for my **Postdoc** in Prof. Tobias Heed's _Reach and Touch Lab_.
In 2021 I took a position as a **_Senior Scientist_** in Tobias's new lab at the University of **Salzburg**, Austria.
