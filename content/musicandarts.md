# Music <i class="fas fa-volume-up" style="font-size:120%; color:limegreen;"></i>
I am a bass player and (occasional) composer. 
At the moment, I have two bands. 

## Ego Super
Ego Super is a psycho-rap-rock band. As the genre description suggest, the music (and lyrics) are inspired by (clinical) psychology. My band members are friends with whom I studied psychology and with whom I also played in other bands before. I am happy that we are still making music together although we unfortunately don't live in the same city anymore. 
Our most recent (2021) release is called "Kaviar Katharsis".

You can find out more about the band on their [website](https://linktr.ee/egosuper).

### Kaviar Katharis video
This video gives an idea about the band. The track is about excess and decadence. I am the actor in the green dress. The singer is my friend Daniel and the guy in the grey robe is my friend Pit and the drummer of the band.

## Soulclub
Since 2022 I also play bass in a Salzburg-based funk and soul band called Soulclub. 
We cover songs that are groovy and fun to play. Here is an impression from a live concert.

## Concatenate
A former band is called _concatenate_ and it was a duo featuring [Marta Beauchamp](https://martabeauchamp.net/). 
We composed and play instrumetnal music of various styles, ranging between _Neue Musik_, Jazz, Folklore, and dreamy atmospheric music. 
In 2021, we released our album "U+1F407; U+1F990".

# Quadratisch Rekords <i class="fa-solid fa-square" style="font-size:120%; color:limegreen;"></i>
In 2008 or so, I have founded a music label together with friends. 
It is called quadratisch (the German word for square-shaped) rekords. 
If you are interested, visits the label's [website](http://www.quadratisch-rekords.de/).

# Animation <i class="fa-solid fa-film" style="font-size:120%; color:limegreen;"></i>
For some years, especially through the first years of my PhD, wenn I discovered dataviz and programming, I produced square-shaped animations that were based on mixing filmed material or videos from internet with data-generated visuals (e.g. based on stochastic processes such as random walks).
I have created a sub page [here](../tags/animation/) to show some of the material.
Be careful to make sure you have a good internet connection for the subpage because it creates some traffic.
